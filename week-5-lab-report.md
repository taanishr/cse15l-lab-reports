# Part 1

## Failure-inducing input
```
public void testReverseInPlace() {
  int[] input2 =  { 1, 2, 3};
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input2);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3, 2, 1 }, input2);
}
```

## Input which does not induce a failure
```
public void testReverseInPlace() {
  int[] input1 =  { 3 };
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```

## Symptom

## Bug
### Before
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}
```

### After
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    int temp[] = new int[arr.length];
    System.arraycopy(arr, 0, temp, 0, arr.length);
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = temp[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}
```

reverseInPlace initially accessed the original array instead of making a copy. This meant that the array would become a mirror image of the elements in the second half of the array. By making a copy and accessing that copy instead, the method theny properly swapped the beginning and end elements.

This command line option captures the lines before and after the matched content along with the matched line. In this case, `2` was provided as the number of lines to capture. This may be useful while looking through a long code base and you want to key in on the context surrounding a certain function call or variable mention.

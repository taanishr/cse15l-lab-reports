# CD:

**1. No arguments**
Output:
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$
```

a) Current working directory when command was run:
```/home```

b) The filesystem consisted of a home directory, which contained a lecture1 subfolder (containing a messages directory with some files), a java binary, a java file, and a readme. When cd is ran with no arguments, the directory is changed to the home directory ```/home``.

c) CD doesn't print anything to the terminal when successful, so no output means it worked.

**2. Path to a directory as an argument**
   
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1/
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
```

a) Current working directory when command was run:
```/home```

c) CD doesn't print anything to the terminal when successful, so no output means it worked.

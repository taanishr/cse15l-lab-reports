Keys pressed: `<s><s><h><SPACE><t><r><e><j><a><@><i><e><n><g><6><.><u><c><s><d><.><e><d><u>`
Here, I logged into the remote server by typing in each character of `ssh treja@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

# Step 2: Cloning my fork of the repository
![Clone step](/clonestep.png)
Keys pressed `<g><i><t><SPACE><c><l><o><n><e><CTRL><V>`
Here, I cloned my fork of the repository by typing the command `git clone` then copying and pasting the ssh key from my fork on github, resulting in the full command being `git clone git@github.com:taanishr/lab7.git`.

# Step 3: Running the failing steps
![Running failing steps](/failedtests.png)
Keys pressed: `<c><d><SPACE><l><a><b><7><ENTER><b><a><s><h><SPACE><t><TAB>`
Here, I entered the directory where the repository was cloned by typing `cd lab7`, and then ran the test script with `bash test.sh`. I used tab while calling bash so I wouldn't need to fill out the entire file name.
